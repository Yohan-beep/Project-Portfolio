               <p>Hi Yohan,

                  Welcome to the program! I have written some feedback here that you need in your first two weeks of study. You do not need to answer them or respond to them now. Hope to see you soon!</p> 
            
               <p>Daphne</p>
            
            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 3%; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 8%;">Motivation:</h3>
            
               <p>You put a great effort into understanding your motivation which is definitely intrinsic. What made you decide to come to the Netherlands and follow the program in Middelburg ?</p>

               <p>The Netherlands is known to have one of the best universities for undergraduate programs and in general have excellent facilities for higher studies. I came to Middelburg, specifically HZ because of the way the program ICT is taught as I felt this that this program suited me more than any other program.   </p>
            
            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 3%; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 8%;">SWOT:</h3>
            
                <p>What strengths from being a good sportsman can be implemented in everyday study life? What can you use from having to train / care for dogs in your everyday study life? how is being an introvert a weakness? what would it make a strength? How can you use others or a system to pull you out of the details and back to the greater picture? How can you use others to maintain your motivation ?</p>

                <p>1. Being active in sports helps in developing a positive mindset. It helps in keeping the mind fresh and also plays a role in moulding and developing good qualities that every human being should have. </p>

                <p>2. Taking care of my dogs helps in keeping the mind fresh and overall helps in having a good mood to work or study.</p>

                <p>3. Being an introvert is not always a sign of weakness but not building relationships or trying new things with different people in a new place is not good either.  However, it helps in having focus on the work you do as you dont pay much heed to what others are doing.</p>

                <p>4. I stop thinking for a moment after which I take a blank piece of paper and just write down the main points of what I am working on. This helps get more clarity as to what I am working on and what needs to be done to achieve my goals in a much more efficient manner.</p>
                  
                <p>5. Seeing how well others do well and excel either academically or in sports is a great source of motivationas I too wish to be the best in what I do.</p>
