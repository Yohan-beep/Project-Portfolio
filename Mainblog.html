          <p style="font-size: 18px;">STUDY CHOICE ACTIVITIES.</p>
          <p>Since I am a student who did not study CS in the final 2 years of my school, I attended courses across various platforms like Youtube, Coursera, and Udemy where I learned the basics of web development, Javascript, HTML, C, etc . I did this to make sure that I had a genuine interest in the field of IT before I made the choice of taking the course of ICT. </p>
  
          <p>MOTIVATE YOUR STUDY CHOICE</p>
          <p>My fundamental interest is to study core CS programming to design and develop software systems, web services and mobile applications from basics as I would like to move into the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I would like to use these skills to help build new technology and products that can help society create a more environmental friendly lifestyle. I would also like to enable companies create wealth that can help them achieve their financial and social goals in a much more cost effective manner.</p>
  
          <p>AFTER COMPLETING THE STUDY</p>
          <p>I wish to get into the software engineering field. I would like to design, program and maintain software at a multinational company in the tech industry. I am interested in developing the necessary skills to analyse the user's needs and then develop software solutions to solve today's climate change, environmental and energy problems, provide entertainment to people or create technology solutions for everyday problems in society.</p>
