            <p>
               Google works on multiple forms of technology, projects and buisnesses at the same time. They work on AI(Artificial Intelligence) which is an extremely important, popular and a debateable topic right now. 
               Google aims to create AI in different forms so as to make the lives of people easier. It makes AI and technology with the the objective that

               <ul>
                  <li>It makes the average person's live more Socially Beneficial</li>
                  <li>Aim to avoid creating or enforcing biasness. </li>
                  <li>Makes sure that AI that is getting build, provides appropriate opportunities for feedback, relevant explanations, and appeal. They try to make sure that all the products getting build will be subject to appropriate human direction and control.</li>

            <p>
               Google is known to have one of the best working culture in the corporate world. Google promotes the idea of "Uncomfortably exciting," and now all its employees follow the same. The company also shares all possible information with employees to maintain transparency in the process. Apart from providing perks like free food, fun games, nap pods, on-site physicians, Google also keeps an eye on their employee's satisfaction and happiness. Like, Googlegeist is an annual survey that collects responses of all Googlers on company culture, compensation, managers, work-life balance, career opportunities, and so on. 
            </p>

            <p>
               What I love about google is the amount of projects that they work on and the complexity of issues that they aim to solve. I believe very few companies have the same level of ambition that google has in advancing the technology that is accessible to the common public irrespective of social and economical factors. Along with this it also helps to grow you as a person on a professional level and on a personal level as well since you get the oppurtunity to work among the smartest minds around the world. The other few companies that I have the same feeling for is microsoft and amazon which I would be talking about further in this article.

             <p>
               Microsoft is one of the few companies that aims to solve problems from almost all fields of life, starting from AI, graphics & multimedia, upto health, linguistics, cryptography, privacy, etc. Some of the projects that they have been/or worked on are 
               <ul>
                    <li>Project Maia.</li>
                    <li>AI at Scale.</li>

            <p>One of these is Project Malmo which is set out to address questions on how artificial intelligence learns to make sense of complex environments? That learns from others, including humans on how to interact with the world? AI that learns transferable skills throughout its existence, and applies them to solve new, challenging problems? Project Malmo sets out to address these core research challenges, addressing them by integrating (deep) reinforcement learning, cognitive science, and many ideas from artificial intelligence.

               The Malmo platform is a sophisticated AI experimentation platform built on top of Minecraft, and designed to support fundamental research in artificial intelligence.</p>

            <p>
               The culture at Microsoft as a whole is very unique and different from a generic tech company. At Microsoft, their primary concern is not how to create new products, but how empathy can create an innovative mind. Microsoft strongly believes that the ability to empathize sparks the innovation that helps employees create products and services that meet the unmet and unarticulated needs of customers.
            </p>

            <p>
               Microsoft supports the growth of employees as individuals since their development directly influences the company's growth. Managers encourage employees to be a part of something beyond Microsoft. Employees are prompted to do things that make them happy and may be completely unrelated to their job at Microsoft.
            </p>

            <p>
               Microsoft put a lot of time and effort into ensuring that everyone comes together as one. They host meetings and programs to encourage team bonding, and then tasks are assigned to groups to put their team spirit to the test.
            </p>

         <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5%; font-size: 32px;">Amazon</h3>
            
            <img src="Images/jj.webp" width="400" height="auto">
            <p>
               Amazon makes money through its retail, subscriptions, and web services, among other channels. Retail remains Amazon's primary source of revenue, with online and physical stores together accounting for the biggest share. However, Amazon is now diversifying its buisness model by a large extent. 
            </p>
            <img src="Images/jojo.avif" width="350" height="auto">

            <p>
               Various roles offered in Amazon are :
               <ul>
                  <li>Software Engineer.</li>
                  <li>Software Development Engineer - Aims to disrupt and build next generation of distributed cloud computing products</li>
                  <li>Data Engineer - You will be deep-diving complex mathematical algorithms to answer key business questions and will be developing and testing prototype solutions with above algorithmic techniques.</li>
               </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
               Amazon continously works on ways of improving the efficiency with which a person lives. Amazon is creating a $1 billion venture investment program called the Amazon Industrial Innovation Fund (AIIF) to spur and support innovation in customer fulfillment, logistics, and the supply chain. As customers increasingly shop online and look for even faster delivery, Amazon continues to invent new ways to raise the bar on customer and employee experience while working with other companies focused on those fields.
            </p>

            <img src="Images/gg.webp" width="350" height="auto">

            <p>
               Alongwith that Amazon continues to deliver on its roadmap for Project Kuiper, a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite system designed to provide fast, affordable broadband to unserved and underserved communities around the world.
            </p>

            <p>
               Amazon is also working on providing technologies and services like Just Walk Out technology, the Amazon Dash Cart, and Amazon One. 
             </p>

             <p>
               When it comes to work culture, Amazon is quite different from other companies. For example, the way they hold meetings is quite different. Unlike other companies, opinions and ideas involved in making business decisions are documented. The size of these documents is usually about six pages. These documents drive a lot of clarity when resourceful information is to be discussed. 
               This culture frowns against the use of PowerPoint, as it ruins the flow and clarity of meetings. They also prefer having employees spend more time on strengthening their claims than throwing up designs and styles that add no value to the meeting.
             </p>

             <p>
               Amazon uses its two pizza rule to stimulate agility in its corporate culture. This rule stipulates that each team must be small enough to be fed with two pizzas.This logic is now applied across all departments in Amazon to increase productivity.
