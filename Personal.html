               <p>Strengths What do you do best? What are your positive traits?</p>
               <p>I am a very keen sportsman. I'm good at sports like cricket and football and am also a good runner. Some positive traits of mine are that I am determined to reach my goals once I set them. Irrespective of what I do, I always try to give my best. I like to help people and give back to the community in some way or the other. I enjoy engaging in light cooking activities and spending time with my pets (2 adopted dogs). I like all animals and I am a strong supporter of animal rights.</p>

               <p>Weaknesses What personality traits may be holding you back in your studies / career?</p>
               <p>I am an introvert because of which I always hesitant to experiment with new ideas especially when I am in a completely new environment. I am at times uncertain of what I want to do but determined to do it once I decide and set my path. I am a person who has an eye for detail and tend to do a deep-dive into the topics/subjects and often in the process lose sight of the big picture especially when I have deadlines etc. </p>
   
               <p>Opportunities How can you turn your strengths / weaknesses into opportunities?</p>
               <p>The best way to turn my strengths/weaknesses into opportunities is by first understanding my interests and self-reflecting. If I am self-aware, I must then try and connect with people with the same interests as mine, irrespective of how shy and awkward I feel. With this, I believe I can get to explore new things, and as a result, I can get opportunities to better myself.</p>

               <p>Threats What obstacles do you face to succeed as a student? Could any of your weaknesses prevent you from succeeding in your studies / career?</p>
               <p>I become pretty laid-back when I do not keep deadlines for my goals. I tend to procrastinate if I do not have a particular time frame to complete any project or course. When I am faced with problems that are much more difficult to overcome, I lose confidence, making it hard to focus for a certain period before I get back to solving it. Another obstacle I face as a student is the difficulty of maintaining a constant sense of motivation throughout the year.</p>
